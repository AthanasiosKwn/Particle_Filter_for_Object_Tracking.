The goal of this project is to implement an object tracking method using the Particle Filter algorithm, 
with the aim of tracking a moving object in a sequence of frames. The implementation is in Python, 
utilizing the OpenCV and NumPy modules. The repository contains the input video, the output video,
a .py file and a pdf file describing the entire process.
